Was the “Three Strikes Law” enacted in Arizona?	No	Yes
4	provo	2	real	1	4	"Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course. "	Was Liza preparing for Easter?	No	Yes
5	provo	2	real	1	5	"Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.

"	Did Mrs. Darling notice the stars outside her window? 	No	Yes
6	provo	2	real	1	6	"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.

"	Was Peter carrying a gun?	No	Yes
7	provo	2	real	1	7	"Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange. Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't see the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything she had ever seen before, except the shaggy man and Toto. "	Did Dorothy recognize where she was?	No	Yes
8	provo	2	real	1	8	"The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity.

When the body becomes overheated and cannot eliminate this excess heat, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible."	Does heat stroke occur when the body cannot eliminate the excess heat? 	Yes	No
9	provo	2	real	1	9	"It was a forbidding challenge, and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive abilities, not to mention his self-confidence, that the admiralty agreed to fund him. No lighthouse had ever been built out to sea on an isolated rock before. The Eddystone is hard enough to avoid, but landing on it is a separate challenge entirely. "	Did Winstanley plan to build a lighthouse?	Yes	No
10	provo	2	real	1	10	"A clergyman remarked to him, ""The Lord is on our side."" I am not at all concerned about that, replied Mr. Lincoln; ""for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right.

11	provo	2	real	1	11	"Known as Rapa Nui to the island's inhabitants, Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of pictographs. It has been found carved into many oblong wooden tablets and other artifacts from the island's history. The art of writing was not known in any nearby islands and the script's mere existence is sufficient to confound anthropologists. "	Is Rongorongo a musical script? 	No	Yes
12	provo	2	real	1	12	"Some months later, Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a dash of ingenuity. He walked into his bank one day and asked to withdraw his entire account balance, but with an unusual stipulation: He wanted as much of the cash as possible in one dollar notes. "	Did Mr. Larson withdraw his account in one dollar notes?	Yes	No
13	provo	2	real	1	13	"Bob Murphy, the Senior PGA Tour money leader with seven hundred thousand, says heat shouldn't be a factor.

17	provo	2	real	1	17	"Owls are more flexible than humans because a bird's head is only connected by one socket pivot. People have two, which limits our ability to twist, Forsman added. Owls also have multiple vertebrae, the small bones that make up the neck and spine, helping them achieve a wide range of motion. "	Are owls more flexible than humans? 	Yes	No
18	provo	2	real	1	18	"Even in the same animal, not all bites are the same. A new study finds that because the force in a muscle depends on how much it is stretched, an animal's bite force depends on the size of what it is biting. The finding has direct implications for ecology and evolution."	Does the study find that all bites from the same animal are the same?	No	Yes
19	provo	2	real	1	19	"Interestingly, the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave quite like science's best current models predict, so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full of surprises. Chemists cannot even predict with any certainty whether these materials will exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature."	Are the heavy isotopes easy to predict by Chemists?	No	Yes
20	provo	2	real	1	20	"Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it. It was a monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. "	Did Buck enjoy his monotonous life? 	No	Yes
21	provo	2	real	1	21	"These days, neuroscience is beginning to catch up to musicians who practice mentally.

"	Are most of the same neurological regions invoked by mental practice as by real practice? 	Yes	No
22	provo	2	real	1	22	"Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.

23	provo	2	real	1	23	"When a nucleus has all of its proton shells or neutron shells loaded to full capacity, the layers can align so well that each shell can spoon intimately with its attractive neighbors, forming a more compact sphere that fits well within the strong nuclear force's area of influence. "	Is the passage about astronomy?	No	Yes
24	provo	2	real	1	24	Hybrid vehicles have a halo that makes owners feel righteous and their neighbors feel guilty for not doing as much to save the planet.

Yes	No
26	provo	2	real	1	26	"An early task will be to make sure the newfound microbes were not introduced while drilling through the ice into the lake, which involved a hot-water drilling technique designed to greatly reduce or eliminate any contamination that might come from other kerosene-based drilling technology, Christner said. "	Were the scientists drilling in the ocean?	No	Yes
27	provo	2	real	1	27	"Very similar, but even more striking, is the evidence from athletic training.

"	Is practicing a complex physical task in the mind an effective rehearsal strategy? 	Yes	No
28	provo	2	real	1	28	"A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met with great opposition, mostly from farmers.

Has Neptune completed its first orbit around the sun since being discovered by Earthlings? 	Yes	No
33	provo	2	real	1	33	"When attacked, a skunk's natural inclination is to turn around, lick its tail and spray a noxious scent.

No	Yes
49	provo	2	real	1	49	"For centuries, time was measured by the position of the sun with the use of sundials. Noon was recognized when the sun was the highest in the sky, and cities would set their clock by this apparent solar time, even though some cities would often be on a slightly different time.

"	Is stress a risk factor for both depression and anxiety? 	Yes	No
53	provo	2	real	1	53	"When it comes to having a lasting and fulfilling relationship, common wisdom says that feeling close to your romantic partner is paramount.
